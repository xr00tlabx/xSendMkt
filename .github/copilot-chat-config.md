## üéØ Best Practices for Copilot Chat

### Context Providing
Always include relevant context when asking questions:
- Mention the specific technology stack (Electron + React + TypeScript)
- Reference existing performance requirements
- Include file paths and component names
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### Specific Prompts
Use specific, actionable prompts:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Create a TypeScript interface for SMTP configuration with validation"
‚ùå Vague: "Help with email stuff"
```

### Follow-up Questions
Use follow-up questions to refine solutions:
```
@workspace How can I make this implementation more performant?
@workspace What security considerations should I add?
@workspace How would you test this functionality?
```

### Project-Aware Requests
Reference project-specific patterns:
```
@workspace Following the existing patterns in this codebase, how should I implement [feature]?
@workspace Using the same architecture as the SMTP configuration, create [new feature]
```
